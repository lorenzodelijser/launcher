# ðŸš€ Launcher

Launcher is a startup page made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The page will wave and greet me and give several options for opening a collection of webpages to focus on work. Grouped by Ideation, Design, Development and writing. It supports system dark and light theme.

For this project I used vanilla-tilt.js for the 3d hover effect and Boxicons for icons.
