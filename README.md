# ðŸš€ Launcher

![Launcher Image](./cover-image.png "Launcher Image")

Launcher is a startup page made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The page will wave and greet me and give several options for opening a collection of webpages to focus on work. Grouped by Ideation, Design, Development and writing. It supports system dark and light theme.

Check out the live version on: [launcher-lorenzo.vercel.app](launcher-lorenzo.vercel.app)

For this project I used vanilla-tilt.js for the 3d hover effect and Boxicons for icons.
